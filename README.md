# BlobTube

**BlobTube** is a low-bandwidth video streaming service written in Go, because sometimes you don’t need 4K ultra-HD cinematic pores — you just need the video to *load*.

Built for constrained networks, hobby servers, edge deployments, and people who still remember buffering circles as a personality trait.

## 🚀 What Is BlobTube?

BlobTube is a lightweight, efficient video streaming platform designed to:

- 📦 Serve video as simple binary blobs (hence, *Blob*)
- 🧵 Keep memory usage tight and predictable
- 🌐 Perform reliably on low-bandwidth or high-latency networks
- ⚡ Leverage Go’s concurrency model for clean, scalable streaming
- 🛠 Stay minimal, hackable, and delightfully unbloated

If traditional streaming platforms are luxury cruise ships, BlobTube is a stubborn little tugboat that always reaches the harbor.

## 🧠 Philosophy

- Keep it simple.
- Make it fast.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- No enterprise buzzword soup.
- If it compiles and streams, ship it.

## 🏗 Why Go?

Because:

- Goroutines are cheap.
- The standard library actually works.
- Cross-compilation is painless.
- You enjoy feeling morally superior about memory usage.

## 🧪 Status

BlobTube is under active development.  
Which means:

- Things may break.
- APIs may change.
- You will probably refactor something at 2am.

## 📡 The Vision

A streaming service that:

- Works on weak connections
- Runs on tiny servers
- Doesn’t melt CPUs
- Doesn’t need 47 microservices and a Kubernetes cluster named after a Greek god

## Errata

Stay tuned.  
Or don’t. It’ll buffer eventually.
